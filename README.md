# Project Repository for COSC 310: Software Engineering (Project A) 

--- 

This is a Spring Boot Application. All files are found in the 'Projecta-Backend' folder. 

## Basic Information: 

- The project skeleton is generated from the Spring Initializer at https://start.spring.io/.
- The 5 folders (Model, Repository, Service, Controller, Config) defined in **src\main\java\com\hackademics** ... Will contain the implementation for most necessasry components of the application.
- The database is currently hosted on Aiven, for security purposes I limited access to certain IPv4 addresses, the University address is permitted so you may only be able modify the database when runnning the backend on the University network.

### Make sure it works: 
To make sure the project works, open your terminal in VSCode and navigate to the project directory. **By Default** it will open to the Repository Directory, make sure to navigate to the project directory first. Then in your terminal run: mvn **spring-boot:run** 

It should take 1-5 seconds to launch and then display the following line: 

**: Started ProjectaBackendApplication in 1.672 seconds (process running for 1.975)**

If you see this, the application is running. To terminate the application, in your terminal use the command **Ctrl + C**, and then if it asks you to terminate the batch job, press **'y'** and then **enter**.
